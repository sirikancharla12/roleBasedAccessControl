# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in MongoDB

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in a MongoDB database. RBAC is a method of restricting access to resources based on the roles assigned to users. With RBAC, you can control who has access to specific data and operations within your MongoDB database.

## Features

- Define custom roles with specific permissions.
- Assign roles to users to control access.
- Use MongoDB's built-in authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## Prerequisites

- MongoDB installed and running.
- Node.js and npm installed (if using a Node.js-based setup).

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/roleBasedAccessControl.git
cd roleBasedAccessControl
